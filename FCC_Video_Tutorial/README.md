This folder documents my notes from following the 'Learn C For Beginners' video course from FreeCodeCamp.org on YouTube.

Reminder Note: 

I need to compile my C programs before they will run. Previously, I have been using the command:

```
cl CFILE.c
```

When compiling a C program, you need to use the -o flag to specify the name of the output file. For example:

```
gcc -o hello hello.c
```
